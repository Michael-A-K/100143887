# Functional Battles!
>The Wizards Council of the Mid-lands needs your help. In order do defeat the evil invaders of the Old World Order, certain calculations must be completed in order to properly cast spells of the appropriate size and strength. 

## Objectives required to complete
This quest has us working with functions, variables, and mathematical operators. 

### Objective 1 - Designing a Plan 
Ensure you have all the necessary formulas in order to complete the tasks.

### Objective 2 - Cloning 
Don't forget to 'Open from VCS' this repo into `PyCharm`.

### Objective 3 - Committing to Test Project for Functionality
Commit your code often to trigger testing to happen as you make progress on the quest.

## Quest Requirements
**All function names should be as stated in order to avoid errors on automated tests.**

### Objective 1 - The functions
There are several various pieces of information we can pull different numerical values.  Doing these functions helps us with function writing, variables, and function calling.

- Perimeter of the Rectangle `periRect`

- Trapezoidal area `trapArea`

- Conical volume `conicVol`

- Cubic surface area `cubicBarrier`

- Circular area `blastArea`

- Temperature conversions (Fahrenheit to Celsius) `atmoShift`

- Slope of a line `elevationVect`


	
### Objective 2 - Finishing the main
- Call all the methods on a variety of sample data in the main to fully test your formulas
- Display the various results to the user in a friendly format as demonstrated

### Objective 3 - Pushing
Reminder to Commit and Push code from `PyCharm` back to GitHub.
